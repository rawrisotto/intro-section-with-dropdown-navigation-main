## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to create a full web page with responsive navigation bars instead of a single page component. It was quite challenging to get the navigation bars right and I think there are tons of improvements that could be done.

### Continued development

I will try to find ways to make the navigation bar HTML, CSS and JavaScript neater.
